I am currently a 2nd-year graduate student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My main interest is characterizing and explaining physical properties of various kinds of materials at atomic scale. For now, I am working in Prof. Jian-Min Zuo's research group learning electron microscopy related techniques.
